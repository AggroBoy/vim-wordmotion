*vim-wordmotion*

INTRODUCTION					*vim-wordmotion*

Customizable word motions for Vim.

This is one word under Vim's definition:
>
	CamelCaseACRONYMWords_underscore1234
	^
<
With this plugin, this becomes 9 words:
>
	CamelCaseACRONYMWords_under_score1234
	^    ^   ^      ^    ^^    ^^    ^
<
CUSTOMIZATION					*vim-wordmotion-customization*
=============

						*g:wordmotion_prefix*
Set `g:wordmotion_prefix` if you don't like having the default word motions
(`w`, `b`, `e`, `ge`, `aw`, `iw`) hijacked.
E.g.,
>
	let g:wordmotion_prefix = "\<Leader>"
<
						*g:wordmotion_extra*
Define additional word categories with `g:wordmotion_extra`.
E.g., to treat `<WordsInAngleBrackets>` and `|WordsInPipes|` as single words:
>
	let g:wordmotion_extra = [ "<\a\+>", "|\a\+|" ]
<
NOTE: this takes precedence over any existing word categories.
